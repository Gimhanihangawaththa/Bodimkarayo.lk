# Bodimkarayo 🏠

**Smart Roommate & Property Finder Platform**  


---

## 📘 Project Overview

**Bodimkarayo** is a smart digital platform designed to simplify the process of finding rooms, properties, and compatible roommates, focusing on the Sri Lankan rental and boarding culture (“bodima”).  

The platform will connect tenants, landlords, and potential roommates through an intelligent recommendation system, verified profiles, and map-based property listings.



## 🧠 System Architecture (High-Level)

Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)  
⇄ Backend (Spring Boot REST API)  
⇄ Database (MariaDB)  
⇅ ElasticSearch (for fast property search)  
⇅ Cloudinary (for media storage)  
⇅ AWS (for deployment and hosting)
